How to develop for python-openzwave
===================================

Fork the project on Github.

Get the sources :

   git clone https://github.com/yourname/python-openzwave

You can install all the dependances to develop for python-openzwave
using the command :

   sudo make developer-deps

You must now install python-openzwave in develop mode. Depending on
which python version you prefer, use :

   make venv2-dev

or

   make venv2-dev

Keep in mind that your updates must be python 2 / python 3 compatible.

Develop, test, debug, test, ... :)

Update the documentation if needed. You surely found the documentation
useful, so please keep it up to date.

It a good idea to add automatic tests.

Launch the full test suite (for python 2 and python 3) :

   make venv-tests

At last but not least, submit your request with the result of tests in
the comment.

If you don't follow the previous steps, your PR will be refused or
letting in pending state until I've got time to test it.


Documentation
=============

First, install the dependances :

   sudo make doc-deps

Documentation is managed with sphinx.

Don't update txt and rst files (README, INSTALL, ...) in the root
directory, update the RST sources in docs.
